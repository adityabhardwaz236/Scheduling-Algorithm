‚ö° Energy Efficient CPU Scheduling Algorithm
This project simulates a Round Robin CPU Scheduling Algorithm with an energy-efficient mode, aiming to optimize CPU usage and reduce power consumption during process scheduling.

üöÄ Features
Implementation of Round Robin Scheduling in Java.

Frontend simulation built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Displays CPU scheduling behavior visually with energy-saving considerations.

User-friendly interface for inputting process data and quantum time.

Optional energy-efficient mode for reducing context switching or idle cycles.

üí° How It Works
The Java program (tRoundRobin.java) simulates a traditional Round Robin scheduling mechanism.

On the frontend, users can enter process details (like arrival time, burst time, and quantum).

An energy-efficient mode reduces power waste by optimizing idle times and minimizing context switches where possible.

The simulation dynamically displays scheduling sequences and CPU usage.
